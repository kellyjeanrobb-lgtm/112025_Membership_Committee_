## Project Overview

This project is a React-based data visualization dashboard designed to modernize membership reporting. It transitions reporting from static sheets to dynamic, interactive visualizations. 



It provides insights into the membership lifecycle, from candidate pipeline flow to financial throughput and demographic census data.



## Business Objectives

* **Pipeline Visibility:** Tracking candidates through the 5-stage governance process (Applicant → Invited).

* **Financial Integrity:** Monitoring monthly dues flux, capital fund contributions, and initiation fee audits.

* **Census Analysis:** Visualizing demographic shifts to inform retention strategies.



## Technical Highlights

* **Framework:** React.js

* **Visualization:** Recharts (Composed Charts, Funnels, and Bar Charts)

* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for responsive layout

* **Icons:** Lucide-React



## Key Features

1.  **Pipeline Funnel:** Tracks volume and conversion rates across membership intake stages.

2.  **Flux Analysis:** Comparative analysis of member inflow vs. resignation outflow.

3.  **Cash Economics:** Monthly breakdown of Application Fees vs. Capital Contributions.
